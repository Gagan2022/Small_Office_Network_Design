# Small Office Network Design – Basic LAN

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and validating a **basic small office Local Area Network (LAN)**. It demonstrates fundamental networking concepts such as LAN topology design, IPv4 addressing, and end-to-end connectivity.

The project was created as **hands-on practice after completing CCNA M1 & M2**, using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Design a functional LAN for a small office environment
* Connect multiple end devices using switches and a router
* Assign IPv4 addresses to all devices
* Ensure successful communication across the entire network
* Validate connectivity using basic network testing

---

## 🏢 Network Scenario

A small office with multiple employees requires a simple and reliable internal network where all systems can communicate with each other.

The network should be:

* Easy to understand
* Scalable for future growth
* Properly documented

---

## 🧩 Network Components Used

* **1 Router** – acts as the default gateway
* **2 Switches** – connect end devices
* **Multiple PCs** – represent office users
* **Ethernet connections** for device connectivity

---

## 🌐 Network Design Summary

* The network follows a **star topology**
* Switches operate at the access layer to connect end devices
* The router provides network-wide connectivity
* All devices are part of a single LAN

---

## 🧮 IP Addressing Plan

* A private IPv4 address range is used
* Each device is assigned:

  * Unique IP address
  * Subnet mask
  * Default gateway

An IP addressing table is created to document all assigned addresses.

---

## 🔍 Connectivity Validation

The network is validated by:

* Verifying correct IP configuration on all devices
* Testing connectivity between PCs
* Confirming successful communication across switches and router

---

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

* LAN design fundamentals
* Network devices and their roles
* IPv4 addressing
* Default gateway concept
* Basic network troubleshooting

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

* Cisco Packet Tracer
* Basic Cisco IOS concepts

---

## 📂 Project Artifacts

* Network topology diagram
* IP addressing table
* Connectivity test results

---

## 🚀 Learning Outcome

This project strengthened my understanding of how real-world LANs are designed, addressed, and validated, bridging the gap between networking theory and practical implementation.
